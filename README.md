#### Usage

- To create a task, type your task in the text input and press enter.
- Existing tasks can be edited by clicking on the pencil icon.
- To delete a task click on the wastebasket icon.

#### Technology

I wrote this by hand with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I didn't use any JavaScript libraries or frameworks, because I think it is good to learn to write JavaScript without libraries.

#### Development

To deploy, run:

```
surge .
